# BinMulator a Native Binary Emulator Library and Utility

Most emulators for malware detection are written in Python and fail when certain emulated functions do not exist. The goal of BinMulator is to provide an open-source framework for antivirus emulation with syscall forwarding and native execution. This means it can be used to perform advanced behavioral detection/protection on endpoints.

**This is a WIP just an idea for now**
